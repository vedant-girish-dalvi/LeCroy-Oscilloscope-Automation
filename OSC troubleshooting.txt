If you cannot connect ping to OSC

1. check IP address and IP subnet of OSC & PC
2. Turn Firewall OFF on OSC
3. select remote protocol as LXI
4. check resource string in osc.connect (change VICP to TICP0 and vice-versa and check if it works. Worked once! Don't know why!)
5. Check if ActiveDSO or VICP Passport is installed (if not, both can be installed from LeCroy website) 


To get the full trigger waveform, set RealTime Sampling mode, Set Maximum Memory and Lock to Trigger Position

If there is some issues qith the execution of OSC, I would suggest to re-initialize the scope settings and then try again.

Please proceed as follows:
- Save your current settings in a setup file via "File - Save Setup".
- Close the oscilloscope application via "File - Exit".
- Open a Windows Explorer and delete the file "D:\Setups\CurrentPnl.lss".
- Close the Windows Explorer and restart the oscilloscope application with a double click on the shortcut "Start DSO".
- You will notice an error message that the setup file can't be found, this message can be ignored. The deleted file will be restored from the system after some minutes.



Note: 
I recommend not to zoom into signals by changing the horizontal or vertical settings or pinching to zoom after an acquisition.
When zooming is required, a dedicated Zoom function should be used. In case you then want to save/fetch just the zoomed part of the signal, you simply need to change the source in your code to the Zoom function.
When you zoom by changing the horizontal or vertical settings or pinch to zoom, Fetch Waveform only gives you the part of the trace which is currently visible.
